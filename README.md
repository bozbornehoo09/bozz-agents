# bozz-agents

Context-management and review skills for AI coding agents.

Two families of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) that keep a
project's *knowledge* — its decisions, architecture, rules, and docs — accurate
and coherent as the code evolves, then stress-test that knowledge against itself:

- **`update-*` skills** — the **write** side. A discover-and-dispatch
  orchestrator (`update-context`) plus eight narrow skills, one per
  authoritative content layer (decisions, strategy, architecture, rules,
  AI tooling, open questions, orientation, work tracker). Run at the end of a
  session to capture what changed in the right place.
- **review skills** — the **check** side. A four-member review family
  (`docs-review`, `skill-review`, `plan-review`, `code-review`). Each fans out
  to 3–4 specialist briefs in parallel, reports findings as `BLOCK`/`FIX`/
  `SUGGEST`, and returns a verdict of `READY` / `READY-WITH-FIXES` / `REVISE`.
  Every specialist runs under an **anti-hallucination contract**: each finding
  needs a verbatim quote and a `file:line` citation, or it is dropped.

It's a **local developer tool**. Nothing imports it; you install the skills into
your agent (user-level) and they're available across every project you open.

## Format & portability

Everything here is authored to the open **Agent Skills** standard (`SKILL.md`
folders), released by Anthropic and adopted across 30+ tools. The same files
work in **Claude Code** and **Codex** with no converter — what differs between
tools is only the directory each one reads skills from. There is **no
dependency on any third-party skill-manager CLI**; a sync tool is an optional
convenience you can add, not a requirement.

## Install

### Claude Code (plugin + marketplace)

```
/plugin marketplace add bosborne09/bozz-agents
/plugin install bozz-agents@bozz-agents
```

Skills then invoke as `/bozz-agents:docs-review`, `/bozz-agents:update-context`,
and so on. Updates are a `git pull` away (or `/plugin marketplace update`).

For a quick local try without the marketplace, symlink the skills into your
user skills directory:

```
ln -s "$PWD/skills"/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Codex

Codex discovers skills under `.agents/skills/`. Point it at these skills (repo,
user, or admin scope) — see [`codex/README.md`](codex/README.md).

## Customize for your project

The skills ship with sensible defaults (the conventional `docs/decisions/`,
`docs/architecture/`, `.claude/rules/`, `CLAUDE.md` layout). To adapt:

1. Copy `config/context-manifest.example.yaml` to your project as
   `context-manifest.yaml` and remap the layer paths.
2. Replace the **domain briefs** under `skills/plan-review/references/` and
   `skills/code-review/references/` — those encode the *Prism* project's
   architecture and are included as a worked example.

Full guide: [`docs/customizing.md`](docs/customizing.md). The pattern itself is
explained in [`docs/concepts.md`](docs/concepts.md), and the original Prism
instantiation in [`docs/prism-case-study.md`](docs/prism-case-study.md).
